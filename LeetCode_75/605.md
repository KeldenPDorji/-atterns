# 605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing 0's and 1's (where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, and `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:**  
  `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]`, `n = 1`
- **Output:**  
  `true`
- **Explanation:**

  | Plot | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  |------|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Plant|   |   | F |   |   |

  One flower (F) can be planted at position 2.

### Example 2
- **Input:**  
  `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]`, `n = 2`
- **Output:**  
  `false`
- **Explanation:**

  | Plot | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  |------|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Plant|   |   | F |   |   |

  Only one flower can be planted, not two.

## Constraints
- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `flowerbed[i]` is 0 or 1.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

---

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed, n):
        count = 0
        length = len(flowerbed)
        for i in range(length):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                empty_left = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i-1] == 0)
                empty_right = (i == length-1) or (flowerbed[i+1] == 0)
                if empty_left and empty_right:
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                    count += 1
        return count >= n
```
